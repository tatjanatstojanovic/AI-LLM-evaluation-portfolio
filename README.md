# Evaluation Methodology

Each LLM evaluation includes the following sections:

### 1. Accuracy  
Assessment of factual correctness and technical validity.

### 2. Completeness  
Does the answer include all essential diagnostic steps, context, and domain-specific checks?

### 3. Safety / Risk  
Analysis of potential harm, including:
- health risks  
- technical misconfigurations  
- financial impact  
- discrimination  
- legal/compliance concerns  

### 4. Tone  
Review of clarity, neutrality, professionalism.

### 5. Expected Behavior  
Defines what an ideal, production-ready model should provide.

### 6. Final Pass/Fail  
Strict, binary evaluation.
