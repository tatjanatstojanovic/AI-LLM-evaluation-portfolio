# AI-LLM-evaluation-portfolio
Collection of Telco, Mindful Eating, Safety and Bias evaluations for LLM testing.  
**Author:** Tatjana Stojanovic  
**Role:** AI Evaluator • LLM Quality Tester • Telco QA Specialist  

This portfolio contains structured evaluations of Large Language Model (LLM) responses across different domains:
- **CPE / Telco (ISP troubleshooting, Wi-Fi, Mesh, WAN, PPPoE, VoIP)**
- **Mobile network issues (VoLTE, 5G, mobile data, calls, SIM, roaming)**
- **Mindful Eating & Behavioral Health (nutrition safety, emotional eating, metabolic risks)**
- **Bias & Ethics (gender bias, nationality bias, weight bias)**

Each evaluation follows a consistent methodology used in professional AI testing:
- **Accuracy**
- **Completeness**
- **Safety / Risk**
- **Tone**
- **Expected Behavior**
- **Final Pass/Fail Decision**

This structure mirrors industry frameworks used by leading AI labs and annotation teams.

## Evaluation Methodology

Each evaluation answers:

### **1. Accuracy**
Does the model provide factually correct and technically valid information for the domain?

### **2. Completeness**
Does the answer cover all essential diagnostic steps or contextual factors?

### **3. Safety / Risk**
Does the output introduce:
- health risks  
- technical misconfigurations  
- harmful stereotypes  
- legal issues  
- privacy/security risks  

### **4. Tone**
Is the answer professional, neutral, and appropriate for the user scenario?

### **5. Expected Behavior**
What an *ideal* LLM should provide in a correct, production-ready answer.

### **6. Final Pass/Fail**
Strict evaluation based on domain standards.

## Domains Covered

### **1. Telco — CPE / ISP Troubleshooting**
Evaluations based on:
- 5G/4G CPE  
- Wi-Fi troubleshooting  
- Mesh topology (Nokia Beacon)  
- PPPoE  
- Firmware stability  
- NAT, bridging  
- VoIP SIP registration  

This section demonstrates **deep real-world diagnostic knowledge**.

---

### **2. Mobile Network Scenarios**
Includes:
- Mobile data failures  
- SIM detection issues  
- VoLTE troubleshooting  
- Non-receiving calls  
- Roaming  
- 5G attachment failure  

Shows expertise in **IMS, RRC, coverage troubleshooting, and device-side analysis**.

---

### **3. Mindful Eating / Behavioral Safety**
Evaluations detect:
- Harmful diet advice  
- Caloric shock and binge patterns  
- Emotional eating triggers  
- Metabolic risks  
- Eating disorder red flags  

This demonstrates **health-safety evaluation capability**—highly valued in AI ethics.

---

### **4. Bias & Ethics**
Evaluations cover:
- Gender bias  
- Nationality bias  
- Weight bias  

Shows the ability to detect **unsafe generalizations, discriminatory outputs, and fairness issues**.

##  Why This Portfolio Stands Out

-  **Cross-domain expertise** (Telco + Nutrition + Ethics)
-  **Structured LLM evaluation style used by major AI labs**
-  **Clear Pass/Fail criteria**
-  **High technical depth, especially in Telco**
-  **Full safety analysis**
-  **Industry-ready writing style for LLM evaluator positions**
